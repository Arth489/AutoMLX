This growth is attributed to the increasing demand for convenient, ready-to-eat meals and the rising consumer preference for fresh and nutritious foods. With busy lifestyles becoming more common, consumers are looking for easy-to-prepare yet healthy options that do not compromise on quality or freshness. The shift toward perishable prepared food products, such as fresh salads, sandwiches, and ready-to-cook meals, is also being driven by an expanding urban population and the growing popularity of on-the-go eating habits. Market trends indicate a surge in consumer interest for organic and clean-label products, which further fuels the demand for perishable prepared food. As health-consciousness among consumers rises, demand for food that is minimally processed and free from preservatives is intensifying. Additionally, advancements in packaging technology, such as vacuum-sealing and modified atmosphere packaging, have played a key role in extending shelf life while maintaining product freshness.
