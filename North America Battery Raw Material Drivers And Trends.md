<p><h2>North America Battery Raw Material Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The North American battery raw material market is being driven by the increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems. As governments and industries focus on sustainability, the shift toward clean energy is pushing the demand for batteries, particularly lithium-ion batteries, which require essential raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Moreover, advancements in battery technology, which improve energy density and longevity, are further fueling the need for high-quality raw materials. The region’s growing emphasis on reducing carbon emissions has led to higher investments in the production and mining of these critical materials.</p><p>In addition to the rising demand for EVs, the North American market is witnessing a trend toward localized supply chains and increased investment in domestic mining and refining capacities. To reduce dependency on overseas suppliers and ensure a steady, secure supply of critical materials, both private and public sectors are focusing on building a self-sufficient infrastructure for battery raw materials. This trend is supported by government incentives and funding programs designed to boost domestic production, thus enhancing supply chain resilience and reducing the risks associated with geopolitical disruptions in the global market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=60463&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=281" target="_blank">North AmericaBattery Raw Material Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaBattery Raw Material Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Battery Raw Material Market size was valued at USD 27.6 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 40.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.6% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaBattery Raw Material Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Valence Technology Inc.</Li><Li> BYD Company Limited</Li><Li> Saft Groupe</Li><Li> Battery Technology Inc.</Li><Li> TCL Hyperpower Batteries Inc.</Li><Li> Danionics A/S</Li><Li> GP Batteries International Limited</Li><Li> E-One Moli Energy Ltd.</Li><Li> Energizer Holdings Inc.</Li><Li> Spectrum Brands Incorporated</Li><Li> Varta Consumer Batteries GmbH & Co.</Li><Li> Samsung SDI Co.
